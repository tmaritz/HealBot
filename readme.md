# HealBot

A tool to reduce the amount of button mashing in the FFXI game.

### Summary

By default, HealBot will monitor the party that it is in.  Commands to monitor
or ignore additional players can be found below.

Buffs gained via job abilities are now supported, but have not yet been tested
extensively.  Composure has been confirmed to work.  With the addition of job
ability support comes support for prioritization (since, for example, Composure
should be used before other buffs are applied).

Detection of whether the local healer is able to act has been improved for when
debuffs such as sleep or petrify are active, so that now it should not try to
spam spells while unable to act.  This is apparent by the text box in the top-
left corner of the screen displaying the message 'Player is disabled'.

Bard songs are officially unsupported at this time.  YMMV - it cannot handle the
fact that there is no notification given when one song overwrites another, or
maintaining multiple buffs that have the same name.  That being said, if you
only want to maintain 2-3 songs without using a dummy song, it may work.  I have
an idea about how to support BRD songs, so that should be coming soon. Until then
use Singer - https://github.com/Ivaar/Windower-addons/tree/master/Singer

GEO isn't well supported at this time. Alternative:

AutoGEO - https://github.com/zpaav/AutoGEO

COR is also not well supported at this time. Alternatives:

Roller - https://github.com/zpaav/Roller

AutoCOR - https://github.com/Icydeath/ffxi-addons/tree/master/AutoCOR

Coming soon:
The ability to cast offensive spells on an assist target's target.
Work in SCH AOE Regen with Max Duration / Potency.
May try AOE options for other buffs as well (Protect, Shell, etc.).

### IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

HealBot now supports IPC between multiple instances of Windower running on the
same computer when both characters have HealBot loaded!  This means that HealBot
will now be even better at detecting the buffs/debuffs that are active for
characters on the same computer!

Only the healer's HealBot needs to be on - the non-healer just needs to have
HealBot loaded to be able to tell the healer's instance about its active buffs
and debuffs.

## Requirements
### HealBot depends on libs/lor

These libs can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/lorand-ffxi/lor_libs).
Full url: https://github.com/lorand-ffxi/lor_libs

To install, unzip the download and place the internal most `lor` folder into the `Windower\addons\libs` folder.

To verify the correct folder setup, click on the `lor` folder and if it has the `lor-*.lua files` inside that `lor` folder it's good to go.
If not, go one level deeper until you see those files.

### Required addons
shortcuts and cancel
Please install these and turn them on.
This can be done through the Windower Addons options.

## How to use

### Settings

If you have the shortcuts addon installed, your `aliases.xml` file from that addon
will be loaded, and those aliases will be available for use when specifying
buffs.

You can edit/add/remove buff lists that can be invoked with the
`//hb bufflist listName targetName` command in `data/buffLists.lua`.  The order of
buffs within the list does not affect the order in which they will be cast.
Follow the syntax of existing sets when adding/editing your own.

You can also edit/add/remove debuff lists that can be invoked with the
`//hb debufflist listName` command in `data/debuffLists.lua`.
Follow the syntax of existing sets when adding/editing your own.

You can modify the priority with which other players will be attended to by
editing `data/priorities.lua`.  Note that detection of players' jobs is not
perfect at the moment, so it is better to specify individual players' priorities
by name.  Lower numbers represent higher priority.  Follow the syntax of
existing sets when adding/editing your own.

Monster abilities that do not display what debuffs they cause are specified in
`mabil_debuffs.lua`.  This list is woefully incomplete, but I plan on vastly
expanding it in the near future.  If you decide to add any, I would greatly
appreciate it if you would share what you have added.  If you add something, and
it isn't detected, please notify me, and I will attempt to make sure that it can
be detected in the future.

Place the healBot folder in `.../Windower/addons/`

* To load healBot: `//lua load healbot`

### Custom / Saved Settings and loading

There is an option to load up custom settings file that is setup by the end user.
This will minimize the amount of commands that are run to get healbot up and moving.

To load custom settings healBot: `//hb custom (Custom Settings List Name)`

The location of the custom settings are in `data/custom_settings.lua`.
Reference the custom lists already in there for some ideas. Further explanation of the settings and examples are below.

These settings can work along with the `data/buffLists.lua` and `data/debuffLists.lua` lists that are setup to ensure that buffs and debuffs are brought in.
Reference each of these as well to setup customized buffs and debuff lists to be brought in.

### Custom Setting Example lists with explanations.
